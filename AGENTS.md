# AGENTS.md

This repository is a personal chezmoi source tree for managing dotfiles and
machine bootstrap configuration. Treat it as sensitive by default.

## Purpose

- Manage shell, Git, SSH, editor, credential-helper, VPN, and tool
  configuration through chezmoi.
- Bootstrap supported machines with Ansible after chezmoi applies the source
  tree.
- Keep encrypted private configuration in the repository while keeping
  decrypted files outside Git.

## Structure

- `dot_*`, `private_*`, and `executable_*` paths follow chezmoi source-state
  naming.
- `dot_zshrc.d/` contains zsh startup fragments.
- `dot_scripts/` contains user scripts that chezmoi installs into `~/.scripts`.
- `dot_config/bootstrap/` contains the Ansible bootstrap playbook, task files,
  and Galaxy requirements.
- `run_onchange_exec_ansible.sh.tmpl` installs Ansible when needed and runs the
  bootstrap playbook after relevant bootstrap files change.
- `run_after_chezmoi_mgmt.sh.tmpl` creates ignored decrypted-helper symlinks
  after chezmoi applies files, only when the decrypted target exists.
- `*.age` files are age-encrypted files managed by chezmoi.

## Sensitive Data Rules

Never expose secrets, personal data, employer names, internal hostnames, tokens,
passwords, API keys, certificates, private keys, private email addresses, or
work-specific identifiers in plaintext repository files, commit messages, logs,
or final answers.

Before finishing changes, inspect the tracked diff with:

```bash
git status --short --ignored
git diff --cached
git diff
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If decrypted files are present, they must remain ignored. They should appear as
`!! ...decrypted...` in `git status --short --ignored`, not as tracked or staged
files.

## Encrypted File Workflow

Encrypted files use an ignored symlink next to the encrypted source file so the
plaintext target in `$HOME` can be edited naturally.

Example pattern:

```text
dot_zshrc.d/encrypted_05_work.zsh.age
dot_zshrc.d/05_work_decrypted.zsh -> $HOME/.zshrc.d/05_work.zsh
```

Use the same pattern for other encrypted files:

- The repository stores only the `.age` file.
- The decrypted companion is a symlink to the real target under `$HOME`.
- The symlink name must include `_decrypted` so existing ignore rules prevent it
  from being checked in.
- Add or update the matching guarded `test -f ... && ln -sf ...` entry in
  `run_after_chezmoi_mgmt.sh.tmpl` so chezmoi recreates the helper symlink after
  apply. Do not rely on only creating the symlink manually.
- Do not commit decrypted symlinks or decrypted plaintext.
- Do not re-encrypt changed plaintext unless the user explicitly asks. If a
  decrypted target was changed, report that re-encryption is still needed.
- Decrypted files should contain a short reminder comment with the matching
  `chezmoi add --encrypt ...` command when the file format safely supports
  comments. Do not add comments to strict formats such as JSON, certificates, or
  key material.

## Ansible Bootstrap

Ansible is part of the chezmoi apply flow:

- `run_onchange_exec_ansible.sh.tmpl` is a chezmoi run-on-change script.
- It hashes the bootstrap files so updates to the playbook or requirements
  rerun the bootstrap.
- On Debian/x86_64 it installs Ansible with `apt-get`, installs Galaxy
  requirements, then runs `~/.config/bootstrap/main.yaml` with become prompting.
- On Darwin/arm64 it expects Homebrew, installs Galaxy requirements, then runs
  the same playbook.
- The playbook currently supports Debian/x86_64 and Darwin/arm64 only.

When editing bootstrap behavior, keep changes small and verify YAML syntax where
possible. Avoid adding employer-specific package sources, internal URLs, or
private credentials to the playbook.

Generated Ansible state and caches, such as `.ansible/`, must stay ignored and
out of commits.

## Pre-Commit

This repository uses pre-commit for basic hygiene and safety checks:

- Community hooks handle whitespace, final newlines, YAML syntax, merge
  conflicts, private-key detection, large files, and executable shebangs.
- Local hooks run `shellcheck` for bash scripts/templates and `yamllint` for
  YAML files.
- Local safety hooks verify that `*.age` files are age-armored and that
  `_decrypted` helper files are not tracked.
- Some hooks auto-fix files. After running pre-commit, review the diff and do
  not keep unrelated formatting churn unless it is intentional.

Run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Change Discipline

- Keep changes surgical and aligned with existing chezmoi naming conventions.
- Do not modify encrypted `.age` files unless explicitly requested.
- Do not remove unrelated ignored symlinks or user-local files.
- Preserve executable bits for scripts under `dot_scripts/executable_*`.
- Keep `.pre-commit-config.yaml` focused on checks that work for a chezmoi
  source tree: generic hygiene, shell/YAML linting, age-file sanity, and
  preventing tracked decrypted files.
- Prefer `rg`, `find`, `git status`, and `git diff` for inspection.
